# Virtual Influencer Instagram Image Analysis

Welcome to the Virtual Influencer Instagram Image Analysis project! This project aims to analyze and extract various features from Instagram images posted by virtual influencers. These features include hue, saturation, and contrast analysis, face detection, emotion detection, presence of multiple faces, and more.

## Project Overview

Virtual influencers have gained popularity in recent years, and their social media presence, particularly on platforms like Instagram, plays a crucial role in engaging with their audience. This project seeks to understand and analyze the content of virtual influencers' Instagram posts to extract valuable insights.

## Features

- **Hue, Saturation, and Contrast Analysis:** Extracts the hue, saturation, and contrast of images to understand their visual characteristics.
- **Face Detection:** Detects faces in images and analyzes face ratio, position, and presence of multiple faces.
- **Emotion Detection:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and analyze facial expressions in images, providing insights into the emotional context of posts.
- **Days Between Each Post and Latest Post:** Calculates the number of days between each post and the latest post to understand posting frequency.
- **Path Extractor from File of Images:** Extracts file paths from a list of images for analysis.
- **Image Part of a Post with Multiple Images or Not:** Determines if an image is part of a post with multiple images or a standalone post.
- **Symmetry Analysis:** Analyzes the symmetry of images to understand visual balance.
- **Clustering:** Utilizes clustering algorithms to group similar images together based on visual features.
- **Visual Balance:** Analyze the visual balance of images to identify any imbalance in composition.
- **Diagonal Dominance:** Identifies if there is any diagonal dominance in images, which can impact visual perception.
- **Mind Perception of Description:** Analyzes the perception of descriptions associated with images based on NLP techniques.
- **Sentiment of Description:** Determines the sentiment of descriptions associated with images using sentiment analysis algorithms.

**Note:** These features can be adapted for feature extraction from any images, not limited to virtual influencer Instagram images.
